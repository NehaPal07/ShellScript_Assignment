Develop a script that creates, sets and displays two variables to the terminal when run. 
Within this script, add comments to explain what the script is doing, what each variable is and, 
using inline comments, what each command is doing.

Solution:
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-34-178 shell_Assignments]$ vi Assignment03.sh
     1  #!/usr/bin/bash
     2  # declare and assignment of the variable

     3  a=10;
     4  b=10;

     5  #Print the variable value

     6  echo 'value of A : ' $a
     7  echo 'value of B : ' $b
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-34-178 shell_Assignments]$ chmod u+x Assignment03.sh
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-34-178 shell_Assignments]$ ./Assignment03.sh
value of A :  10
value of B :  10
