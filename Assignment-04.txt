Create a simple script that does the following:

Echo a full sentence to the terminal
Echo a different full sentence, but redirect it to /dev/null

Run and display the results and make sure the statements appear where intended.


Solution:
ec2-user@ip-172-31-34-178 shell_Assignments]$ vi assignment04.sh
#!/usr/bin/bash

echo "what is your name"

echo "my name is Neha "  > /dev/null

[ec2-user@ip-172-31-34-178 shell_Assignments]$ chmod u+x assignment04.sh
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-34-178 shell_Assignments]$ ./assignment04.sh
what is your name
