Create a simple script containing a single function. 
This function should display a message to clearly indicate it was generated when the function was run. 
Then, display another message outside the function clearly indicating it was generated outside of it.


Solution:
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-34-178 shell_Assignments]$ vi Assignment21.sh

#!/usr/bin/bash

Test () {

  echo "I am Inside at function"

}

Test

echo "I am at Outside of the function"


[ec2-user@ip-172-31-34-178 shell_Assignments]$ chmod u+x Assignment21.sh
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-34-178 shell_Assignments]$ ./Assignment21.sh
I am Inside at function
I am at Outside of the function
