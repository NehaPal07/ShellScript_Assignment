Create a script that interacts with the user. Prompt them to guess a secret number between 1 and 5. 
Read the guess from the terminal and assign it to a variable. 
Using the 'if' statement from the course, test that value to determine if they guessed the right number 
(you choose the correct value). If they do, display a success message, otherwise do nothing.



Solution:
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-34-178 shell_Assignments]$ vi Assignment11.sh
#!/usr/bin/bash
a=1
b=2
c=3
e=4
f=5

read -p "Guess the secret number between 1 to 5 :" num

echo "Number is : $num"

for var in $num;
do
if [ "$var" = "$a" ] || [ "$var" = "$b" ] || [ "$var" = "$c" ] || [ "$var" = "$d" ] || [ "$var" = "$e" ] || [ "$var" = "$f" ]; then
   echo "number is correct"
else
   echo "number is not correct"
fi

done

[ec2-user@ip-172-31-34-178 shell_Assignments]$ chmod u+x Assignment11.sh
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-34-178 shell_Assignments]$ ./Assignment11.sh
Guess the secret number between 1 to 5 :4
Number is : 4
number is correct
