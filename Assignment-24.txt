We are going to use nested functions to simulate the kind of abstraction you find in many object oriented languages. Create the following structures in your script:

a function that defines two local variables to hole the number of arms and legs that a human being has.
nested functions, one for each a male and female, that contain the appropriate number of beards that each gender has.
capture the gender as a command line parameter.
test the command line parameter and call the appropriate functions in order to display the characteristics of the indicated gender.


Solution:

[ec2-user@ip-172-31-34-178 shell_Assignments]$ vi Assignment24.sh

#!/usr/bin/bash

body () {

arms=2
legs=2

echo " I am inside the body function with $arms arms"
male
female

}

function male (){

echo "I am male with $legs"

}

function female () {

echo "I am female with $arms"

}

body


[ec2-user@ip-172-31-34-178 shell_Assignments]$ chmod u+x Assignment24.sh
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-34-178 shell_Assignments]$ ./Assignment24.sh
 I am inside the body function with 2 arms
I am male with 2
I am female with 2
