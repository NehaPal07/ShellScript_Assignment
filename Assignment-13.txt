Write a script that assigns a variable that contains a list of all shell scripts (*.sh) in the current directory 
(command redirection). Using the 'for'statement from the course, iterate through that list of files and display 
the filename of each and cat out the contents to the terminal.


Solution:
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-34-178 shell_Assignments]$ vi Assignment13.sh

#!/usr/bin/bash

FILES=`find /home/ec2-user -name "*.sh"` >> Files.txt

for var in $FILES
do
 echo $var
done

[ec2-user@ip-172-31-34-178 shell_Assignments]$ chmod u+x Assignment13.sh
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-34-178 shell_Assignments]$ ./Assignment13.sh
