Create a simple text file containing a list of super heros (or some names if preferred), use at least four values, one per line in the file.

Write a bash shell script that then reads that file and displays it line by line on the terminal window.


Solution:
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-34-178 shell_Assignments]$ vi hero.txt

Bhagat Singh
Sukhdev
Subash Chandra Bose
Raja Ram

[ec2-user@ip-172-31-34-178 shell_Assignments]$ vi Assignment16.sh

#!/bin/bash
filename='hero.txt'
n=1
while read line; do
# reading each line
echo "Line No. $n : $line"
n=$((n+1))
done < $filename

[ec2-user@ip-172-31-34-178 shell_Assignments]$ chmod u+x Assignment16.sh
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-34-178 shell_Assignments]$ ./Assignment16.sh
Line No. 1 : Bhagat Singh
Line No. 2 : Sukhdev
Line No. 3 : Subash Chandra Bose
Line No. 4 : Raja Ram
