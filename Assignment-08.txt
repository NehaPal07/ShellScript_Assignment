Create a script that interacts with the user. You will want to prompt the user to enter the 
following information (which you will capture and place into the following variables):

FIRSTNAME
LASTNAME
USERAGE

Greet the user with their name and current age displayed and then calculate and display their age in 10 years.

[ec2-user@ip-172-31-34-178 shell_Assignments]$ vi Assignment08.sh
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-34-178 shell_Assignments]$ chmod u+x Assignment08.sh

#!/usr/bin/bash

read -p "your firstname: " FIRSTNAME
read -p "your lastname:  " LASTNAME
read -p "your age     :  " USERAGE

echo "Hi $FIRSTNAME $LASTNAME and welcome in the world of unix !!"

cal=`expr $USERAGE + 10`

echo "$FIRSTNAME will be $cal after 10 years"

[ec2-user@ip-172-31-34-178 shell_Assignments]$ ./Assignment08.sh
your firstname: Neha
your lastname:  Pal
your age     :  26
Hi Neha Pal and welcome in the world of unix !!
